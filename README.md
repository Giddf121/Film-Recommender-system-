# Film Recommender System
A simple film recommender system built in python 3.9 using sci-kit learn. 

Movie recommender systems are often flawed. Instead of comparing the content and similarities between films. They often recommend off of the basis of viewer similarity or topic similarity. Film similarity is often poorly reflected through these methods. Through my own experience similairity in films is most reflected through the personnel of a film production. (directors, writers,and such). So in this project I sought to create my own Movie Recommender system that would aim to correct some of these common mistakes.
